# Loto App

## Overview
A Flutter app for playing Loto game.

### Description
The app simulates the traditional loto game experience where numbers are drawn randomly from a pool of 90 numbers, just like in the physical game. Each drawn number is clearly displayed and tracked, making it easy to follow the game's progress.

### Key features:
- 90-number grid display
- Random number drawing
- Last 3 numbers display
- Reset functionality

## ðŸ’¡Idea
The idea came to me while playing loto today as I write these lines.
